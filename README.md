# *💳 Online Payment Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning 🚀*
### Welcome to the ultimate solution for secure online transactions!
🔍 Say goodbye to payment fraud with our cutting-edge machine learning-based detection system. This repository hosts not only the project but also a sleek, interactive Streamlit app for hands-on use!

## 🎯 Project Highlights
Built Using: Advanced ML techniques for accurate fraud detection.

Milestone-Driven Development:

### 🛠 Milestone 1: Data Preprocessing
Every great machine learning model starts with clean, reliable data! Here's how we prepared ours:

**🧹 Missing Values Handling:** Replaced or removed missing values for consistent datasets.

**🧮 Feature Scaling:** Standardized numerical features for improved model performance.

**🔎 Outlier Detection:** Identified and mitigated outliers to enhance accuracy.

**🎨 Feature Engineering:**
- Created meaningful features to enrich the dataset.
- Added time-based features like transaction hours for deeper insights.
  
**⚖️ Class Imbalance Handling:**
- Applied SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to balance the dataset, ensuring fairness in fraud detection.
  
### 🔍 Milestone 2: Model Selection and Implementation
After preparing the data, we dove into the world of algorithms. Here's what we did:

**🤖 Tried and Tested Algorithms:**
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Decision Trees
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- XGBoost
  
**🏆 Final Model:**
After extensive experimentation, we chose **XGBoost** for its exceptional performance in accuracy and precision.
Why XGBoost? It's fast, efficient, and excels at handling imbalanced datasets like ours.
